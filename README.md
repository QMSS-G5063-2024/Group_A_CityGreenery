### Overview 
Our Shiny website offers an immersive exploration of New York City's green spaces. This project comprises three main components:
1. **Tree Visualization:** Dive into NYC's urban forest with our integrated leaflet and static plots. Explore tree counts, density, and park distribution across the city's five boroughs.

2. **Air Quality Analysis:** Delve into air quality data measured by PM2.5 levels across NYC's five boroughs. 

3. **Urban Forestry Reports:** Explore key themes and trends shaping the city's approach to urban forestry from NYC's urban forestry reports. Employ LDA topic modeling and Jaccard Matrix analysis.
